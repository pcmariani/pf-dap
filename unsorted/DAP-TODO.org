* Errors that need to be handled
- "No GDMS Unique ID returned for Compound"
  - Cause: There is no folder in GMDS for that compound name

* Sure up the back-end
- Proper error-handling
- debugging help for scripts
- separate the Querying of the data from the formatting
  - API to get data, must store raw data somewhere
  - API to format data, retrieve raw data from storage
    - is this better? Only if data could be stored in memory
    - Flow could store the raw data in it's state, then send it
      back to integrate. Is that better? probably not
- makes sure that the sql parser can handle a WHERE clause with hard-coded values

* Error handling ideas
- Send errors atomically to db, in addition to caching
- UI to view enriched execution metadata
    - button to retry in debug mode

* Design changes
**  Table Title
- Move table title override out of the list of values modal to it's own config
- Allow editing of table instances, which would include table title override

**  Trasposition
- remove tranposition for pivots
- instead of transposing, the user will switch the PivotOn and GroupBy
- Add configuration for GroupBy rows like PivotOn columns
  - active, reorder, rename

**  PivotOn columns
- option for fixed column width (rather than percentage)
**  Virtual Columns

* Test Cases
- IND Stability
  - unpivoted
  - pivoted
  - pivoted-transposed
** Things to check
- Table title
  - placeholders
  - string replacements
- Table Title override
- Footnotes

* Error Handling
- Defaults
- Limit number of rows in email
- DEBUG mode
